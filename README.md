# Calendar To Do list
An application that allows users to add important dates that they want to remember.
It also allows the user to short it by categories
The data is uploaded to a MYSQL DB

# Inspo 
I didn't want to create another shopping application so i thought a to-do list/organisationial 
would be a great project to work on.
I always love to oraganise my life on paper but I never found the application
that suited me to do it on computer screen.

Below i will show some inspo for my application.
